# helloworld-to-GithubActions-using-Azure
This repo contains a basic hello world to github actions (CI/CD pipeline) using azure to deploy a web app.

Also a secret key is passed by the pipeline to index.html `${secret-value}`,
I set the `${secret-value}` to `SECRET_VAlUE`

A sanity check is added after deployment to check if deployment went fine or not

You can see the application deployed at url: https://witty-grass-09a172510.3.azurestaticapps.net/
